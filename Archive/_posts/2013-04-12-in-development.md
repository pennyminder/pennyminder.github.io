I wanted to give everyone a sneak peek at a new feature for Cashbook that we have in development and will be released soon.  It's called Spending Habits and we think it's a great add-on for Cashbook.  

### What it does &amp; how it works

Wouldn't it be great to know how much you've spent at a particular merchant?  This is what the Spending Habits tab will do in Cashbook.  Not only that it will tell
you how many times you've purchased from them.  

You will be able to view this information for different time periods (monthly, annually, all time, etc) and you will also be able to select multiple merchants to see aggregated totals, for instance all of the different has stations to show how much you've spent on gasoline. 

It works by identifying and grouping related transactions (IE from a single merchant) so that we can make queries against the data for the totals and other calculations like month over month comparisons or trend graphs.

Coming very soon!
