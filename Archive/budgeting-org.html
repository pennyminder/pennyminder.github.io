      Imagine youâ€™ve given yourself a monthly spending limit of $100 for coffee. Halfway through the month you buy a coffee with your debit card, and a minute later you get an alert on your phone that you have spent $88.90 on coffee this month and have $11.10 left in your budget.
      
      <strong>Cashbook helps people understand their relationship with money so they can make better, more informed choices. By setting spending targets, your members will see at a glance how they're doing with their budgeting.</strong>

      No boring lists here. Cashbook's calendar helps members identify their earning and spending patterns over time. View all spending data, only deposits or withdrawals, or even narrow down to a single category like groceries, entertainment, or utilities.
