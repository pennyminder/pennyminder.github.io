We are thrilled to announce that our launch client <a href="https://www.mtlehman.com/"><strong>Mt Lehman Credit Union</strong></a> has launched their instance of Cashbook (branded as Membertrak) and is live! They were an ideal launch partner for us, helping to work out the kinks in the software and our process of implementing.  

They continue to help us define the future of our PFM products both for credit unions (large or small) and their members. MLCU stands as a great example that you do not need to be a large organization to innovate in this day and age. We are very happy to have been part of bringing this project to life.
