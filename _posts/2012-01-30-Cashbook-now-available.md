*Pennyminder is pleased to announce today the launch of Cashbook, our hosted PFM for credit unions*.  Cashbook features a modern HTML5 interface that's mobile and tablet ready, and a real-time interface to the core banking system. These are competitive features that your users and members will expect and appreciate.

*Pennyminder Cashbook* is incredibly easy to implement, and offers best-of-breed customer data security methodology. With an extremely attractive cost-of-entry starting at just $799 per month, it's never been easier to implement PFM and other personal finance applications in the future for your organization. </p>
###Easy Implementation

Implementing Cashbook only requires two things: an authentication service, and a transaction delivery service. Pennyminder has open-sourced it's <a href="https://github.com/sourdoughlabs/juno">juno authentication service</a>. We're currently working on open-sourcing the transaction delivery side as well. All that a financial institution needs to provide is some specific code to integrate with their back-end. Typically, this can be done in a few weeks.

###Safe and Secure

Cashbook's <a href="https://github.com/sourdoughlabs/juno">Juno authentication service</a> utilizes the <a href="http://oauth.net/2/">OAuth2.0</a> protocol, which assures that the user's login credentials never leave the control of the financial institution.

But customer safety and security don't stop there. With Cashbook, your user's personally-identifiable information is never sent to Cashbook -not even customer account numbers. Cashbook only uses a unique indentifier for the user, and transaction details such as amount,description and date.

###More than just PFM

Best of all, when you choose Cashbook your implementation investment pays dividends by giving your institution a platform on which to build and deploy your own mobile and web-based applications. That allows you to customize and develop specialized services that keep your clients coming back.

We're extremely excited by the capabilities and long-term potential of Cashbook. Visit <a href="/cashbook.html" title="Pennyminder Cashbook">the Cashbook page</a> to learn more about it.
