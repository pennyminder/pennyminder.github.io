With the recent release of the new version of Cashbook, I've struggled to find a pricing model that scaled appropriately for Credit Unions of different sizes and offers fair exchange for the product's value. I've always been of the mindset that PFM (and technology in general) should be universally available to everyone, but individual Credit Unions each have unique sets of needs, so what does that accessibility look like on a vendor to customer level?

Enter Cashbook's new pricing structure.  

We've moved from SaaS pricing to a more traditional licensing model. What's not traditional though, is that there are no fixed artificial limits to the license (i.e. CPU's, members, etc.). 

Obtaining a license to use the Cashbook software and its suite of pre-built apps simply requires a one-time payment, and that's it. No recurring monthly or annual charges. But keep reading, cause it gets better...

#### If you have under 1000 Members or Assets less than $10 Million? Cashbook is FREE to use.
That wasn't a typo. We meant to say free. What's the catch? There is none. All that we ask is you cover the cost of implementation and hosting the apps yourself. But if you don't have the capabilities to do either, we can help with both. Not a problem.

#### Over 1000 Members or Assets greater than $10 Million? Pay What You Want!
Again, not a typo. Pay what you want and not a dime more. Why would we do this? Because we want to be a different kind of enterprise software vendor and help as many credit unions as possible empower their members to be smarter with their money. Come up with a price that you feel makes sense according to your needs and circumstances, and we'll honor it.

Not sure what to pay? As a general rule of thumb, $10,000 per 5,000 members is a reasonable starting point in terms of value for the software, but again - what you pay is up to you.

#### Centrals, Leagues and Service Providers (Core banking, etc). 
Represent a number of credit unions?  We have a standard pricing matrix based on the aggregate member total for all credit unions you represent. Contact us for details.

#### Hosting Packages
Pricing for our Cashbook application hosting package is simple: $0.50/Member/Year. 

If your credit union has 4,800 members, you pay $2,400 annually for hosting, which is about the cost of a solid dedicated server these days. If you're a larger credit union that has its own infrastructure in place, you're welcome to host the apps yourselves, but its nice to know we're around if you need a hosting partner.
